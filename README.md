## Project Description
#### Goal

* To recommend movies in a neat format based on user input

#### Importance and Interest

* With hundreds of movies being released per year all over the world in different languages, it becomes increasingly difficult to find one that fits one's tastes. At the same time, one may be constrained by their own movie prefereces, unaware of the untapped potential of the beyond. Most recommended movies are already top movies, with little regard to the rest of the film industry. With this application, the goal is not to only recommend movies, but to introduce the user to new genres and movies that while related to what the user already likes, is not just a list of top movies.

#### Language and Tools

 * C++

#### Input/Output

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Input: Desired genres, Runtime, Rating, and Release Year of Movies

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Output: Movie recommendations based on input

#### Design Patterns
1. Composite Pattern (Jakin Chan): To store movies under specific catagories

2. Visitor Pattern (Matthew O'Grady): Gets the movie objects from their respective categories

3. Decorator Pattern (Gary Ou): To add extra information about the outputted movies

 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the TA during lab time. The TA will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Kanban board. 
 ## Screenshots

 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
